# NitroNet for Sitecore

### What's Nitro?

[Nitro](https://github.com/namics/generator-nitro/) is a Node.js application for simple and complex frontend development with a tiny footprint.  
It provides a proven but flexible structure to develop your frontend code, even in a large team.  
Keep track of your code with a modularized frontend. This app and the suggested [atomic design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) and [BEM](https://en.bem.info/method/definitions/) concepts could help.  
Nitro is simple, fast and flexible. It works on OSX, Windows and Linux. Use this app for all your frontend work.

### What's NitroNet ?

NitroNet is a full integration of Nitro frontends into ASP.NET. It is based on the project [TerrificNet](https://github.com/namics/TerrificNet) which uses [Veil](https://github.com/csainty/Veil/tree/master/Src/Veil.Handlebars) of [Chris Sainty](https://github.com/csainty) in order to parse handlebars templates. Handlebars.js is the primary template engine of Nitro. In summary, NitroNet is a completely new and simple view engine for ASP.NET MVC web applications. You can get more informations about NitroNet on our seperate [Git-Hub Project Page of NitroNet](https://github.com/namics/NitroNet). NitroNet is created by [Fabian Geiger](https://github.com/fgeiger).

### ...and NitroNet for Sitecore ?

The name says it all: NitroNet for Sitecore is a special view engine, based on ASP.NET MVC for the Content Management System [Sitecore](http://www.sitecore.net). It handles all possible presentation scenarios to integrate a Nitro frontend into Sitecore without functional loss (Sublayouting, Placeholders, Experience-Editor Full-Support, Personalization, ...). In addition it's possible to get a hybrid integration with Nitro frontends (based on simple and logic-less View-Pages) and own Razor views (*.cshtml).

## Credits and special thanks

Thanks to all the people who made and released these awesome resources for free!

Special thanks to [Marco Schälle](https://github.com/marcoschaelle) and [Stefan Schälle](https://github.com/schaelle) who fight for a smart way to integrate Frontends into ASP.NET and create the predecessor [TerrificNet](https://github.com/namics/TerrificNet) of NitroNet itself. Marco and Stefan were our opinion leaders of this product.

Also special thanks to [Mark Cassidy](https://github.com/cassidydotdk) for all product commits and propagation of our idea to the whole world.
